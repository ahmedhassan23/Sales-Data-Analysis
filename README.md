# Sales-Data-Analysis
I used Python Pandas & Python Matplotlib to analyze and answer business questions about 12 months worth of sales data. The data contains hundreds of thousands of electronics store purchases broken down by month, product type, cost, purchase address, etc.

And Then ,Using Power BI to Can do more operations for Analysis and Reporting Like:


	•	Orders Count for each Product.
	•	Sum of Sales for each Purchase Address.
	•	Total Of Price For Each Product.
